# Jenkins-Shared-Library

In a scenario where the same Logic is used in a microservice across multiple projects, it seems such a waste to replicate the code across multiple projects. It promotes 
collaborations between multiple teams even when not working on same application.

## Whats the concept?
1. An extension to pipeline 

2. Its written in groovy

3. Has its own repository

4. make it available in Jenkins in Global Pipeline.

4. Shared Logic is referenced in JenkinsFile
